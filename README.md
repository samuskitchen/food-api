# Food Api
This project was based on an article from a [blog](https://dev.to/stevensunflash/using-domain-driven-design-ddd-in-golang-3ee5) but changes were made to the structure, tests and libraries. Also try to implement DDD in the project, this would be a simple implementation of DDD for Golang

The following technologies were used in this project:
- [Golang 1.15](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [go-chi/cors](https://github.com/go-chi/cors)

## Requirements
- Golang 14+
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- go-swagger
    * It is necessary to have this plugin installed, this is the installation process:
    ```bash
        go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger
        go install ./cmd/swagger
    ```

## Generate Mock Interface
This is an automatic mock generator using mockery, the first thing we must do is go to the path of the file that we want to autogenerate:

Download the library
```
go get -u github.com/vektra/mockery
```

We enter the route where you are
```
cd path
```

After entering the route we must execute the following command, Repository this is name the interface
```
mockery -name Repository
```

## Documentation

This is the command that runs the swagger autogenerated documentation
* the document can be generated in the following formats in:
    * yalm
    * json
```bash
swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json --scan-models
```

This is the command to start the server with the documentation
* You can generate the documentation in _swagger_ and _redoc_ that is changed in the variable `-F=`
```bash
swagger serve -F=redoc swagger.json
```

Raise the server without automatic start, with specific port and path
````
swagger serve -F=redoc --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8082 --no-open swagger.json
````

You can get more information in the Swagger documentation:
```
localhost:8082/docs
```

## Quick Run Project
First clone the repo then go to food-api folder. After that build your image and run by docker. Make sure you have docker in your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/samuskitchen/food-api.git

cd food-api
```

#### Start Api
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Down Api
```
docker-compose down --remove-orphans --volumes
```

## Run Project in Server AWS
These are the commands to execute and in the following order

```
cd installers/
```

This command starts the app
```
./installFood-Api.sh
```

This command starts the swagger server
```
./swaggerFood-Api.sh &
disown
```
